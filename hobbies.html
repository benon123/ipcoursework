<h4>Traveling</h4>

    “I love traveling, and I try to take a trip every season. On my last trip to Boston,</br>br my flight was delayed, and I had a show to get to.
</br> As soon as I found out about the delay, I called my hotel to confirm a later check-in.</br> I knew I would have enough time to make my show,
 but I scheduled my rideshare from the hotel to the theater to save time. </br>Once I got to my hotel, I had about 10 minutes to settle into my room and then </br>
 get into my rideshare to the theater.

Traveling allows me to adapt to new situations and use my organization and planning skills to ensure I have the most fun I can.</br>
I try to anticipate possible delays and other interruptions in my travel and always have a list of important contacts,</br>
 such as my hotel front desk or travel coordinator. These strategies prepare me for many possible situations, which is how I approach</br> 
 my event and travel planning as an administrative assistant."

<h4>Volunteering</h4>

<p>
    “Once a month, I volunteer at the local food bank. During my last volunteer shift, I was responsible for </br>
     sorting dry goods so that each package contained a certain amount</br>
     of each food.</br>
     I organized the different cans and boxes by type, and I worked with the other volunteers to correctly bag the goods and provide food to the </br>
     300 community members in need.</br>

Volunteering at the food bank not only introduces me to new people but also allows me to serve my community. I interact with many people of</br> 
different backgrounds who share my passion for giving back. I understand that your company participates in a food drive that helps the food bank.</br>
 Do you ever schedule company outings that include volunteering in the community?”
